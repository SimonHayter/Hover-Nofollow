# Hover Nofollow
The Hover Nofollow Firefox add-on will allow SEO users to reveal if the links on the page use nofollow, simply by hovering over the links. If the link turns green it means the link doesnâ€™t use nofollow and if the link turns red, then you know its nofollow.

A really simple add-on that is quick and easy to use. Simply head over to my [Mozilla Firefox Add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/EN-uS/firefox/addon/hover-nofollow/) and click the install button. Hover Nofollow is compatible with all new versions of Firefox and usable on old versions 13+. If you require documentation on this add-on or support then [please visit my support page](https://www.bybe.net/hover-nofollow/) for this plugin.
